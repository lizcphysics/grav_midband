This repository contains code for reproducing Barish, Bird & Cui (tbd). 

The python scripts generate models for stochastic gravitational wave background sources,
and perform likelihood evaluations using standard sensitivity curves for GW experiments.

SGWB models included are:
- Stellar binaries
- IMRIs (assumed to be like stellar binaries)
- Cosmic strings
- Phase transitions

EMRIs are included but you must obtain the datafile from the authors of Babak et al 2010.

Experiments included are:
- LIGO A+
- TianGo
- B-DECIGO/AEDGE
- LISA
- A generic satellite experiment
